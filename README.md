# Personal PowerShell Profile

This is my personal developer focused PowerShell profile.

It has only been tested with PowerShell 7.4.1 on Windows 11.  
Some features and customizations will not work with older versions of PowerShell.

## Font

Many features depends on using a [Nerd Font] in your terminal.
Install any one from their page, and configure your terminal to use that font.

I recommend _CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font_, which uses Microsoft's [CascadiaCode] as the base.
